## Introduction

The `placeholder` attribute is intended for providing supplemental hints and examples for completing a form. It should be used in conjunction with a standard and persistent label, conventionally placed above the input in question.

Where `placeholder`s are used as primary labels, a number of accessibility and usability issues emerge.

Firstly, the `placeholder` is not supported as an accessible label in legacy browsers and assistive technologies, meaning those users will not hear a label as they focus the control.

For sighted users, there are cognitive challenges with the intermittent nature of the `placeholder` label, resulting in some getting confused and frustrated as they try to remember what it was they were supposed to be entering. Others mistake the `placeholder` text as content and think the field is already complete.

## Scope of the issue

Placeholders-as-labels are found wherever there is a "Get A Quote" / "Get My Quote" form.

* [Home page](https://bulb.co.uk/)
* [About â†’ Our energy](https://bulb.co.uk/energy)
* [Welcome page](https://join.bulb.co.uk/join/quote) (**Join site**)

In addition, the **Join site's** ["My Information" form](https://join.bulb.co.uk/join/quick-signup) has no visible and persistent labels:

## Fixing the issue

In some cases, such as search fields where the label of the submit button, "search", acts as a visible label, a persistent visual label is not really necessary and an invisible textual label need only be provided for assistive technology users. However, on the **Bulb** sites the "Get a quote" (or "Get my quote") label for the submit button does not match the "Your postcode" `placeholder` label.

A label that is both visually persistent _and_ forms the accessible label for the field is therefore recommended.

{{<code numbered="true">}}
<label [[[for="postcode"]]]>Your postcode</label>
<input [[[id="postcode"]]] name="postcode" [[[placeholder="E.g. NR9 5NF"]]]>
<button type="submit">Get my quote</button>
{{</code>}}

1. The `<label>` element should be associated with the&hellip;
2. &hellip;`<input>` by matching the values of the respective `for` and `id` attributes.
3. The `placeholder` is now optional, but should be clearly marked as an example/hint to be replaced, such as by prefixing with "E.g." if included.

To maintain an attractive design for the "Get A Quote"/"Get My Quote" forms, it might help to center align the label, input, and submit button along a vertical axis. ["My Information" form](https://join.bulb.co.uk/join/quick-signup) should left-align its labels as other forms do across the sites.
