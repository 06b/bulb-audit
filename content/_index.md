Welcome to **Infusion**: a pattern library builder for inclusive designers. These are **Infusion's** docs, but they are also an example of a pattern library built with **Infusion**. Here are some of its features:

{{% ticks %}}
* Built with Hugo, so easy to structure content and fast to compile it
* Include live code demos easily, using either CodePen embeds or via inline demo sections (that use Shadow DOM)
* Quickly include WCAG and Inclusive Design Principles references by key
* Easily make sections collapsible without writing HTML
* Choose between plain or line-numbered code blocks
* A responsive, screen reader and keyboard accessible static website as output
{{% /ticks %}}

To get started, take a look at {{% pattern "Installation" %}}.
