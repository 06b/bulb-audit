# Inclusive Pattern Library

## TODO

* Basic layout, with scrollable left column and sticky "back to top" in main content central-column
* Syntax highlighting for code (prism-based, probably)
* Support for areas to showcase working demos _without_ codePen or similar (recommended for just HTML+CSS, probably)
* Support for reporting user-tester notes / quotes?
* TOML: Support for expanded WCAG references
* TOML: Support for cross-referencing patterns
* TOML: Support for color combination illustrations?
