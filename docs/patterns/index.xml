      <description>Infusion is built using the static site engine, Hugo, and NPM. The codebase is available to download on Github. Let&amp;rsquo;s get set up step-by-step.
Install Hugo First you need to install Hugo globally.
OSX users If you are a Mac user and have Homebrew on your system, installing Hugo is simple:
brew install hugo Alternatively, you can manually install Hugo from a package. You can verify the installation was successful by typing:</description>

      <title>Library setup</title>

      <description>By now, you should have followed the  Installation instructions. You should have Hugo and Node installed, and a local copy of a forked version of Infusion. You should also have run npm install in the root of that codebase.
&amp;ldquo;Cleaning&amp;rdquo; the content folder Before you can start documenting patterns, there are a few things still to do in order to get set up. At the moment, your version of Infusion is a facsimile of the original, containing all this documentation content.</description>

      <title>Serving</title>

      <description>Serving locally While you&amp;rsquo;re creating content for your library, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably want to see what the finished product looks like. Fortunately, Infusion is easy to serve locally using the serve command:
npm run serve This will serve your working library from localhost:1313. Whenever you make changes to your library&amp;rsquo;s files, the site will automatically rebuild. No need to refresh the web page!
Publishing on Github Pages Infusion creates a /docs folder containing the latest version of your library whenever you do an npm run build or a git commit.</description>

      <title>Printing</title>
      <link>https://thepaciellogroup.github.io/infusion/patterns/printing/</link>

      <description>Infusion&amp;rsquo;s output site includes a one-page  Print version of the generated library, available at /print-version. So, if your library base URL is https://yourName.github.io/your-library, you can print the whole library — to PDF if wanted — from the following address:
https://yourName.github.io/your-library/print-version     Print styles are also provided for individual pattern pages so, if you wanted to print off a single pattern document, go ahead!
