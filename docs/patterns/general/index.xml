      <title>Color dependence</title>
      <link>https://heydon.github.io/bulb-audit/patterns/general/color-dependence/</link>

      <guid>https://heydon.github.io/bulb-audit/patterns/general/color-dependence/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Color makes interfaces attractive and can sometimes help to reinforce meaning. For example, red is associated with danger in many Western cultures, and may form part of a &amp;lsquo;delete&amp;rsquo; button&amp;rsquo;s design.
But dependence on color alone to communicate important information runs the risk of alienating a range of users, including those with forms of color blindness, and others with monochrome displays.
In each case color is used to differentiate items, a supplementary alternative method of differentiation should also be present.</description>

      <title>Elements cannot be focused</title>
      <link>https://heydon.github.io/bulb-audit/patterns/general/elements-cannot-be-focused/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://heydon.github.io/bulb-audit/patterns/general/elements-cannot-be-focused/</guid>
      <description>Introduction All interactive elements — buttons, links, form controls — need to be focusable by keyboard. If they cannot be focused they cannot be activated, meaning users who depend on the keyboard for navigation will miss out on functionality.
Common mistakes include using &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;span&amp;gt; elements as substitutes for &amp;lt;button&amp;gt;s and links. Or using a link as a button and omitting its href which makes it a &amp;lsquo;placeholder link&amp;rsquo; that does not receive focus.</description>

      <title>Focus styles</title>
      <link>https://heydon.github.io/bulb-audit/patterns/general/focus-styles/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://heydon.github.io/bulb-audit/patterns/general/focus-styles/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Focus styling, provided by user agents by default, is used to indicate which element is currently being focused by keyboard. Typically, focus is achieved by pressing the Tab key. Pressing Tab should focus the next interactive element in the source, invoking the focus style.
Users who rely on the keyboard for page navigation include those with motor impairments due to long term ailments (such as rheumatism) or temporary injuries (like a broken wrist).</description>

      <title>Form errors</title>
      <link>https://heydon.github.io/bulb-audit/patterns/general/form-errors/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://heydon.github.io/bulb-audit/patterns/general/form-errors/</guid>
      <description>Introduction As users attempt to complete forms, it is important they are notified promptly and clearly when they make errors, and are provided with assistance in fixing those errors.
For assistive technology users, completing forms can be especially arduous where one or more of the following are true.
 The invalid state of a field is not communicated The error message is not associated with the field The presence of errors is not communicated on submission  The careful wording of error messages and descriptions is also important, as well as indicating which text is error text without relying entirely on color (see  Color dependence).</description>

      <title>Heading structure</title>
      <link>https://heydon.github.io/bulb-audit/patterns/general/heading-structure/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://heydon.github.io/bulb-audit/patterns/general/heading-structure/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Heading elements are often chosen according to the perceived importance of the text they contain and the sections they introduce. The more &amp;lsquo;important&amp;rsquo; the heading, the higher the heading level and — typically — the larger the font size. An &amp;lt;h3&amp;gt; might be 1.5rem and an &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt; 3rem.
However, headings levels do not simply denote importance, but a hierarchy of page subsections. There are certain rules to creating a hierarchy (or &amp;lsquo;document outline&amp;rsquo;) that should not be broken:</description>

      <title>Inconsistency</title>
      <link>https://heydon.github.io/bulb-audit/patterns/general/inconsistency/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://heydon.github.io/bulb-audit/patterns/general/inconsistency/</guid>
      <description>Introduction An important inclusive design principle, is &amp;ldquo;Be consistent&amp;rdquo;. Interfaces that fail to do so present unnecessary burdens of comprehension to users — especially those who consume HTML semantics, such as screen reader users. In particular, inconsistent navigation schema and page structure can make the user feel disoriented and unsure.
It is appreciated that a consistent experience can be difficult to achieve when managing three separate projects, built on separate technologies, and it is noted that a design system is currently being developed to help diminish the issue.</description>

      <title>List structure</title>
      <link>https://heydon.github.io/bulb-audit/patterns/general/list-structure/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://heydon.github.io/bulb-audit/patterns/general/list-structure/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Along with headings, lists give structure to a web page. They group items together so users know they are related or equivalent.
Assistive technology users find lists especially helpful because most software will identify a list semantically, enumerate its items, and provide shortcuts for navigating between the list items. The NVDA screen reader provides the L shortcut key for navigating between lists, and the I shortcut key for jumping between list items.</description>

      <title>Missing and placeholder labels</title>
      <link>https://heydon.github.io/bulb-audit/patterns/general/placeholder-labels/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://heydon.github.io/bulb-audit/patterns/general/placeholder-labels/</guid>
      <description>Introduction All form elements need labels associated to them. Where a label is not associated, the screen reader user is not informed of the field&amp;rsquo;s purpose upon focusing that field. Screen reader users typically traverse forms by focus, not &amp;lsquo;virtual cursor&amp;rsquo; (element by element).
The placeholder attribute is intended for providing supplemental hints and examples for completing a form. It should be used in conjunction with a standard and persistent label, conventionally placed above the input in question.</description>

      <title>Payment settings issues</title>
      <link>https://heydon.github.io/bulb-audit/patterns/general/payment-settings/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://heydon.github.io/bulb-audit/patterns/general/payment-settings/</guid>
      <description>The following is an accessibility review of the payment settings pages found from dashboard/payments-and-statements/payment-settings.
Heading structure Main page The heading structure is not correct. &amp;ldquo;Payment Settings&amp;rdquo; should be an &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt; (because it is the main heading of the page) and both &amp;ldquo;Payment amount&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Payment date&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Payment details&amp;rdquo; should be &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt; (as subsection headings directly under &amp;ldquo;Payment Settings&amp;rdquo;). See below (&amp;ldquo;Payment details&amp;rdquo; not pictured).
Setup New Direct Debit page &amp;ldquo;Setup New Direct Debit&amp;rdquo; should be an &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt; (and &amp;ldquo;Confirm New Direct Debit Details&amp;rdquo; on the confirmation page).</description>

      <title>Routing</title>
      <link>https://heydon.github.io/bulb-audit/patterns/general/routing/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://heydon.github.io/bulb-audit/patterns/general/routing/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Single-page applications present some unique challenges for accessibility, particularly in regard to routing and the navigation of views.
Views (or &amp;lsquo;screens&amp;rsquo;) in single-page applications attempt to emulate pages in more traditional multi-page sites. Visually, the experience is similar (some content is replace with some other content). However, when replacing content by manipulating the DOM in situ, the experience for screen reader and keyboard users is lacking. Unlike when a page is loaded, a switch in views does not announce the page&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;.</description>

      <title>Skip links</title>
      <link>https://heydon.github.io/bulb-audit/patterns/general/skip-links/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://heydon.github.io/bulb-audit/patterns/general/skip-links/</guid>
      <description>Introduction WCAG 2.0 mandates a &amp;lsquo;bypass&amp;rsquo; mechanism to enable users that navigate web pages by keyboard to skip over introductory content and go directly to the main (unique) content of the page. Without such a provision, accessing page content can be time consuming and arduous.
With the introduction of landmark elements like &amp;lt;main&amp;gt;, it has become easier for screen reader users to navigate between the larger sections of the page using software-specific shortcuts.</description>

      <title>Text alternatives</title>
      <link>https://heydon.github.io/bulb-audit/patterns/general/textual-alternatives/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://heydon.github.io/bulb-audit/patterns/general/textual-alternatives/</guid>
      <description>Introduction For blind users, textual alternatives of important visual information must be provided. Composing that text effectively is a question of context.
For example, a logo that is intended as a study in logo design should include a textual alternative — typically via an &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; tag&amp;rsquo;s alt attribute — that describes the features of the logo, such as the colors and typography. For Bulb&amp;rsquo;s logo this might read something like, &amp;rdquo; expressive, hand written text, in white, and featuring hooped ascenders&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Wording</title>
      <link>https://heydon.github.io/bulb-audit/patterns/general/wording/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://heydon.github.io/bulb-audit/patterns/general/wording/</guid>
      <description>Introduction It&amp;rsquo;s not enough that elements in a web page&amp;rsquo;s HTML are marked up correctly. Where they provide textual labels, these labels need to be readable and descriptive.
 Headings must clearly describe the sections they introduce Labels for links, buttons and form elements must clearly describe the purpose of those controls Page titles must sufficiently describe the page and its purpose  Since headings and links are aggregated into lists by screen reader software, it is important they make sense independent of context.</description>
