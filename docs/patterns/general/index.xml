      <description>Introduction Focus styling, provided by user agents by default, is used to indicate which element is currently being focused by keyboard. Typically, focus is achieved by pressing the Tab key. Pressing Tab should focus the next interactive element in the source, invoking the focus style.
Users who rely on the keyboard for page navigation include those with motor impairments due to long term ailments (such as rheumatism) or temporary injuries (like a broken wrist).</description>

      <description>Introduction Heading elements are often chosen according to the perceived importance of the text they contain and the sections they introduce. The more &amp;lsquo;important&amp;rsquo; the heading, the higher the heading level and — typically — the larger the font size. An &amp;lt;h3&amp;gt; might be 1.5rem and an &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt; 3rem.
However, headings levels do not simply denote importance, but a hierarchy of page subsections. There are certain rules to creating a hierarchy (or &amp;lsquo;document outline&amp;rsquo;) that should not be broken:</description>

      <description>Introduction WCAG 2.0 mandates a &amp;lsquo;bypass&amp;rsquo; mechanism to enable users that navigate web pages by keyboard to skip over introductory content and go directly to the main (unique) content of the page. Without such a provision, accessing page content can be time consuming and arduous.
With the introduction of landmark elements like &amp;lt;main&amp;gt;, it has become easier for screen reader users to navigate between the larger sections of the page using software-specific shortcuts.</description>

      <description>Introduction It&amp;rsquo;s not enough that elements in a web page&amp;rsquo;s HTML are marked up correctly. Where they provide textual labels, these labels need to be readable and descriptive.
 Headings must clearly describe the sections they introduce Labels for links, buttons and form elements must clearly describe the purpose of those controls Page titles must sufficiently describe the page and its purpose  Since headings and links are aggregated into lists by screen reader software, it is important they make sense independent of context.</description>
