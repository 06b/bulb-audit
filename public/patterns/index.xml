      <description>Infusion is built using the static site engine, Hugo, and NPM. The codebase is available to download on Github. Let&amp;rsquo;s get set up step-by-step.
1. Install Hugo First we need to install Hugo globally.
OSX users If you are a Mac user and have Homebrew on your system, installing Hugo is simple:
brew install hugo Alternatively, you can manually install Hugo from a package. You can verify the installation was successful by typing:</description>

      <description>By now, you should have followed the   Installation  instructions. You should have Hugo and Node installed, and a local copy of a forked version of Infusion. You should also have run npm install in the root of that codebase.
&amp;ldquo;Cleaning&amp;rdquo; the content folder Before you can start documenting patterns, there are a few things still to do in order to get set up. At the moment, your version of Infusion is a facsimile of the original, containing all this documentation content.</description>

      <description>Serving locally While you&amp;rsquo;re creating content for your library, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably want to see what the finished product looks like. Fortunately, Infusion is easy to serve locally using the serve command:
npm run serve This will serve your working library on localhost:1313. Whenever you make changes to your library&amp;rsquo;s files, the site will automatically rebuild. No need to refresh the web page!
Publishing on Github Pages The easiest way to host your pattern library so you have a link to share is to run the host command.</description>
