      <description>Before you can set about documenting patterns, you need to know where everything goes. The simplest folder structure looks like this:
└── content ├── _index.md └── patterns ├── name-of-my-pattern.md └── name-of-my-other-pattern.md   /content - This is where all of your content lives. You won&amp;rsquo;t need to visit any other folders very frequently. _index.md — This is the content for your home page. /patterns — This is the folder where individual pattern files are kept.</description>

      <description>In Infusion, design patterns are documented using markdown. To create a new pattern file, just add a file with the .md extension to the /patterns folder. It&amp;rsquo;s recommended you use &amp;ldquo;kebab case&amp;rdquo; to name the file ( words separated by hyphens). For example, a pattern with the title &amp;ldquo;Menu button&amp;rdquo; should probably have the filename menu-button. Then you get a nice clean URL: your-company.com/patterns/menu-button.
If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with writing markdown, there are a number of tutorials available.</description>

      <description>From time to time, you&amp;rsquo;ll be wanting to include images illustrating the documented pattern in hand. Images live in the static folder, which is a sibling of the /content folder you&amp;rsquo;ll be mostly working in.
├── content └── static └── images ├── logo.png └── menu-button.gif   When you first make a copy of Infusion, Infusion&amp;rsquo;s own logo will be included. You should replace this with your own company or project logo.</description>

      <description>Infusion acknowledges that simple markdown is limiting when it comes to writing compelling documentation, so it provides a number of &amp;ldquo;shortcodes&amp;rdquo;. Shortcodes offer a simple syntax for including rich content. For example, Infusion provides shortcodes for including notes and warnings.
Notes You may wish to pick out some content in your pattern&amp;rsquo;s documentation as a note — an aside to the main thrust of the pattern&amp;rsquo;s description. This is possible using the following syntax:</description>

      <description>Cross-references Infusion provides an easy mechanism to cross-reference patterns, by name, using the pattern shortcode. For example, I can reference the pattern here. Here&amp;rsquo;s what the markdown looks like, including the shortcode:
I can reference the &amp;#x7b;{% pattern &#34;Notes and warnings&#34; %}} pattern here.  This saves you having to worry about pathing and decorates the generated link with a bookmark icon, identifying the link as a pattern reference visually.</description>
